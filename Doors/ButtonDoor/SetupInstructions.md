The `Microcontroller`, with the code from [`./Script.luau`](https://github.com/usia6/free-code/blob/main/Doors/ButtonDoor/Script.luau) must contact one `Port` with it's `PortID` set to 1 and the door with it's material accurate to the one configured in the previously mentioned script file.

There's no specified way of opening the door, because to open it you need to send a trigger signal to the attached `Port`, however, since this method may be easily bypassed, every part attached to the port must be locked by the owner of the `Microcontroller`.

The microcontroller must be powered.

An example model has been included in [`ExampleModel.json`](https://github.com/usia6/free-code/blob/main/Doors/ButtonDoor/ExampleModel.json).
