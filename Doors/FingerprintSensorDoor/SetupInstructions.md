The `Microcontroller`, with the code included in [./Script.luau](https://github.com/usia6/free-code/blob/main/Doors/FingerprintSensorDoor/Script.luau) must directly contact a door of the configured material in the previously mentioned script file and at least 1 `TouchScreen`, however, it supports an infinite amount of them.

You may configure additional properties in the header of [./Script.luau](https://github.com/usia6/free-code/blob/main/Doors/FingerprintSensorDoor/Script.luau), such as a Whitelist and the time the door may stay open.

The microcontroller must be powered, but thanks to properties of `TouchScreen`s, they may be powered optionally.

An example model has been included in [`./ExampleModel.json`](https://github.com/usia6/free-code/blob/main/Doors/FingerprintSensorDoor/ExampleModel.json).
